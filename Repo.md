Collin: Completed 1,2,3, 4a, and started 5
-   created the github and worked on writing a script for auto running bandit within a conda enviorment.
-   created the bandit.yaml file to exclude certain directories from being scanned
-   modified the environment.yml file to set up the conda environment for the project
-   created the README file and added team member information
-   created the githooks folder and added the pre-commit hook to run bandit before each commit

Having a standardized enviorment makes for easier collaboration. Initially I worked locally in a wsl running ubunutu. However, this approach is not easily transferable to other devlopers. 
Creating support files such as the yaml files makes for more consistent results. 

Maci:
- completed 1/2 of 4c, integrated logging into scanForSecrets and scanForOverPriviledges functions in scanner.py
  Logging from scanForSecrets function provides users with the total secret-containing keys, while logging from scanForOverPriviledges function provides users with the total privilege issues.


Madie:
- completed 1/2 of 4c, integrated logging into the username, password and key functions in scanner.py
  Although already done in a previous workshop, adding logging info to such a large file was helpful in checking import bodies and methods.
