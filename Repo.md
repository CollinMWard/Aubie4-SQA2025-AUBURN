Collin:
-   created the github and worked on writing a script for auto running bandit within a conda enviorment.
-   created the bandit.yaml file to exclude certain directories from being scanned
-   modified the environment.yml file to set up the conda environment for the project
-   created the README file and added team member information
-   created the githooks folder and added the pre-commit hook to run bandit before each commit

What I learned:
Having a standardized enviorment makes for easier collaboration. Initially I worked locally in a wsl running ubunutu. However, this approach is not easily transferable to other devlopers. 
Creating support files such as the yaml files makes for more consistent results. 

Utilizing the instruction and enviorment files to create github actions provides for many new possibilities with automatic scripts within github. Getting the actions to work with the existing dependencies was difficult as some are windows only and took lots of debugging to identify.

Madie:
- completed 1/2 of 4c, integrated logging into the username, password and key functions in scanner.py
  Although already done in a previous workshop, adding logging info to such a large file was helpful in checking import bodies and methods.
